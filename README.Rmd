# Predictive Modeling Project

## Background Information
1) Don't worry if a code chunk takes a some time to execute. I only included models/code that would execute in less than
    1 minute

### Understanding my code format/style
1) # = comments
2) ## = code that has been "commented out", but could be useful for deeper analysis/understanding of my process

## Steps/Procedures to work through this R-project

## Closing thoughts

## My best model!
